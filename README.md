## Tesla_Stock_Price_Prediction
This project is based on Machine Learning to predict the Tesla Stock price. Here we use python libraries to predict the optimal price of Tesla.
The dataset used in this project is from August 2014 to August 2017. For more convenience, I have uploaded file Tesla_Stock.csv*
